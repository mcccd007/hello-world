# hello-world
I will be a programmer and this is my git hub!

Began reading "The Burden and The Glory" by JFK at the laundromat.
No wonder he was killed.
He called for world disarmament, said that wealth is not but a means to increase the people's inherent value.
It might as well be heresy. 
JFK was rad,  is all I know from the first chapter.
